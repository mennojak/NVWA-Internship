# NVWA-Internship
This is a kanban-style Django web-application to improve efficiency and structure for employees within the export certification process at the Nederlandse Voedsel- en Warenautoriteit (NVWA). The main goal was to prototype and test the application with the employees to figure out whether a more structured approach in the form of an application could solve the issues currently present within the process. This was made for the internship in the 7th semester of my bachelor degree for HBO-ICT at the Christelijke Hogeschool Ede (CHE). This intership was a group project where the members also aided in programming certain parts of the application, where Robbin Kruizinga did the frontend design and Daan Ravenhorst helped in testing the application.
